Check whether a given string is palindrome or not.
Find Factorial value of the given Integer.
Check whether the given number is Armstrong or not(An Armstrong number is one whose sum of digits raised to the power three equals the number itself. e.g 371).
Write a program to print Fibonacci series of n terms where n is input by user -->> 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 ....(ibonacci series in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. )
Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum. 
e.g Input 1: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output 1: 6
Explanation 1: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6. 
Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.
e.g Input 1: s = "leetcode"
Output 1: 0
Explanation 1: 'l' is the first non-repeating character in it which is present at index 0. 
Given an array Arr of size N containing positive integers. Find the maximum sum of a subsequence such that no two numbers in the sequence should be adjacent in the array.
e. g.Input: N = 4, Arr[] = {3, 2, 7, 10}
Output: 13
Explanation: 3 and 10 forms a non continuous subsequence with maximum sum.
Create a function that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing the common elements of the two input lists in sorted order. 
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.

Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
Write a program to implement a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should take input in the form of a string, e.g., "2 + 3", and return the result of the operation. 
e.g Input: '3+2*5'
Output: 13
